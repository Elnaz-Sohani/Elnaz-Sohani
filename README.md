- 👋 Hi, I’m @Elnaz-Sohani
- 👀 I’m interested in studying microplastic and carbohydrate analysis in cyanobacteria, specifically focusing on the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) they produce. I’m exploring how these biofilms interact with microplastics and their potential applications in biotechnology for environmental cleanup and pollution mitigation.
- - 🌱 I’m currently learning about artificial intelligence (AI) and how it can be integrated into biotechnology research, especially for enhancing the analysis of EPS and microplastic interactions, and optimizing bioremediation strategies.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI-driven projects in biotechnology that aim to develop innovative methods for removing microplastics from aquatic systems, utilizing cyanobacteria’s natural abilities and EPS to mitigate pollution.  
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at elnaz.sohani@hotmail.com.  
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m passionate about using biotechnology for sustainable solutions, particularly in the areas of pollution control and environmental restoration, and I’m excited to see how AI can enhance these processes.
